# Data-Driven Testing
>Data-driven is a test automation framework which stores test data in a table or spread spreadsheet format. This allows automation engineers to have a single test script which can execute tests for all the test data in the table.
>In this framework, input values are read from data files and are stored into a variable in test scripts. Ddt (Data Driven testing) enables building both positive and negative test cases into a single test.

Data Driven testing makes it easy and fast to test our software with different range of inputs. In this example, we have made use of Apache POI for reading test data from excel sheet and junit to perform unit testing of a function which calculates GST given hsn code and principle amount.

Clone this repository and perform maven build.
